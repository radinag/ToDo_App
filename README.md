# To Do App
A practical To Do Application that allows a user to enter, edit, delete, and store the to-do list entries. The app requires authentication for any changes to the list.

This is my first attempt at using NodeJS in combination with MongoDB service to explore CRUD. It is a great example of practicing the interactivity between the browser, server, and database.
